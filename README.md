# GraphicsTownJS2015
bug.html and Rotating Box.html are two individual hierarchical animations created using JavaScript and Canvas API. 
New Town is a 3D map based on WebGL. You can download the whole file and click index.html (Best run in Chrome; The texture doesn't seem to work in FireFox.) Implementations include hierarchical models, wrap-around textures that are affected by the moving light, parametric curves and skybox.
